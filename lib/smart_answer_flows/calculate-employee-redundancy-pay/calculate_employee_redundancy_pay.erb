  Redundancy payments are based on age, weekly pay and number of years in the job.

  Your employee's weekly pay is the average they earned per week over the 12 weeks before the day they got their redundancy notice.

  ^If your employee earned less than usual because you used the Job Support Scheme or the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to put them ‘on furlough’, use what they would have earned normally when calculating their redundancy pay, not what they were paid while on furlough.

  Employees only qualify if they’ve worked at least 2 full years for you.
